# b2b-lead-scoring-analytics
## Project Overview:
This project builds a lead scoring system that assigns a numerical score to prospective customers based on their demographic attributes and behavioral data. 
The objective is to predict each lead’s likelihood of conversion and prioritize high-value prospects. 
By enabling sales and marketing teams to focus on leads with the highest expected return, the system aims to shorten the sales cycle, improve conversion rates, and optimize resource allocation.
